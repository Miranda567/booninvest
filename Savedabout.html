          <p>As exciting as the prospect of retirement is, it can also feel daunting. Not only do you have to start living off your savings, but you also need to make sure you don't run out of money. So, how do you build a retirement portfolio that serves both purposes?</p>

                    Making a big withdrawal from your retirement savings in the midst of a downturn can have a negative impact on your portfolio over the long-term. To help protect against that possibility, it's a good idea to add two safety nets to your retirement portfolio

                  <p>
                    Once you have your short-term reserves in place, it's time to allocate the remainder of your portfolio to investments that align with your goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Ideally, you'll choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash investments that will work together to generate a steady stream of retirement income and future growth—all while helping to preserve your money. For example, you could:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Build a bond ladder:</strong> Purchasing bonds with staggered coupon and maturity dates can help even out your portfolio's yields over time and provide a steady flow of income.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Opt for dividend-payers:</strong> Consider adding some dividend-paying stocks to your portfolio. Not only do they offer a regular stream of income, but they also allow your principal to remain invested for potential growth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Stick with stocks:</strong> Make sure you don't dial back your exposure to stocks too soon. Having a larger allocation of stocks in the early years of retirement will help guard against the risk of outliving your retirement savings. Later on, you can adjust your allocation to focus more on generating income and preserving your money
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Shifting your energy:</strong>
                    Investors in the early years of retirement may want a greater allocation to stocks to guard against longevity risk, while those in their later years will want to prioritize income generation and capital preservation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At age 60–69, consider a moderate portfolio (60% stock, 35% bonds, 5% cash/cash investments); 70–79, moderately conservative (40% stock, 50% bonds, 10% cash/cash investments); 80 and above, conservative (20% stock, 50% bonds, 30% cash/cash investments).

 </h3>

                  <p>
                    As you put together your retirement portfolio, you also need to think about the role your savings will play in your overall income plan. For example, how much income do you expect from guaranteed sources like annuities, pensions, and Social Security? <br>
                  <br>
                  If these guaranteed income streams will generate enough income to cover the majority of your expenses, you might be able to maintain a more aggressive stance with your portfolio well into retirement

<h2>Crafting Your Retirement Withdrawal Plan</h2>

 

<p>After years of diligent saving for retirement, transitioning to withdrawing and relying on those funds can evoke some uncertainty. How can you ensure longevity for your savings? Understanding the optimal order for tapping into your assets can significantly impact this endeavor.</p>

 

<h2>Tap interest and dividends</h2>

 

<p>Following that, withdraw any interest and dividends earned from investments within your taxable accounts. Interest is typically taxed as ordinary income, except when derived from a tax-exempt municipal bond or municipal bond fund. Conversely, dividends often face taxation at lower long-term capital gains rates ranging from 0% to 20%, contingent upon factors such as your income level, holding period of the asset, and additional criteria.

Opting to withdraw solely the interest and dividends allows you to preserve your initial investment, potentially fostering growth that could generate further dividends and interest in subsequent years</p>

 

<h2>
Cash out maturing bonds and certificates of deposit (CDs)
</h2>
 

<p>If additional funds are necessary, consider accessing the principal from a matured bond or CD. Typically, you won't incur taxes on the principal, provided you retain the bond or CD until maturity.
<br><br>

Should the funds not be immediately required upon the maturity of your bond or CD, contemplate reinvesting the principal in another bond or CD. This approach forms part of a laddering strategy aimed at facilitating consistent income generation.</p>

 

<h2> Sell additional assets as needed</h2>


 

<p>If your current resources still fall short of covering your expenses, selling additional assets becomes necessary, but the selection may hinge on your tax circumstances.<br><br>

For individuals with modest tax-deferred savings and RMDs unlikely to elevate them into a higher tax bracket in retirement, focusing on taxable brokerage accounts is advisable. Exploring the sale of investments with depreciated value enables capital losses utilization for a tax deduction on capital gains. Furthermore, excess losses can offset ordinary income, with a maximum of $3,000 allowable for this purpose. Prioritize assets held for over a year to leverage long-term capital gains tax rates, which are lower compared to short-term capital gains taxed at income tax rates.
<br>
<br>

Conversely, individuals possessing substantial tax-deferred savings and anticipating RMDs potentially elevating them into a higher tax bracket later in retirement may contemplate withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts once they attain the age of 59½.</p>




 <h2>Save your Roth IRAs for last </h2>
 <p>
   It's generally advisable to defer accessing Roth IRA assets for as long as feasible, given their exemption from RMDs and the tax-free nature of withdrawals commencing at age 59½, provided the account has been held for at least five years. Additionally, leaving a Roth IRA to an heir ensures their withdrawals remain tax-free.

In contrast to Roth IRAs, Roth 401(k)s are subject to RMDs as of 2023. Consequently, if you possess a Roth 401(k), transferring it to a Roth IRA could be advantageous. However, note that this action might reset the five-year holding requirement unless the Roth 401(k) funds are merged into an existing Roth IRA. It's worth mentioning that the RMD requirement for Roth 401(k)s will be eliminated starting in 2024, following the amendments introduced by the SECURE 2.0 Act. Nevertheless, seeking advice from a financial advisor before proceeding with a rollover is always prudent.
